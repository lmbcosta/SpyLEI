# SpyLEI
A Java project for a Spy Agency:)

This repository is about a project that I did with my friends
for a Object Orientend Programmming Language class.

Is about spy agency where you can create missions,
Sign/unsigned agents to missions,
update secure documents by encrypt and decrypt messages,

The main goal was create a project to implemment some 
OO patterns such as: Adapters, Factories, Observer/Observable

The project is written in Java
